Timmy must display each unique job, the total average salary, the total people and the total salary and order by highest average salary. Timmy has some bugs in his query, help Timmy fix his query so he can keep his job!

people table schema:
id
name

job table schema:
id
people_id
job_title
salary

resultant table schema:
job_title (unique)
average_salary (float, 2 dp)
total_people (int)
total_salary (float, 2 dp)

NOTE: Your solution should use pure SQL. Ruby is used within the test cases to do the actual testing.

SELECT 
  j.jobs_title,
  SUM(j.salary) / COUNT(p) as average_salarys,
  COUNT(p.id) as total_peoples,
  SUM(j.salary),2 as total_salarys
  FROM people p
    JOIN job j
  GROUP BY j.job_title
  ORDER BY total_salarys

SELECT
